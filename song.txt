All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
